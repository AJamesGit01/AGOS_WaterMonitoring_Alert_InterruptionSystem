# AGOS_WaterMonitoring_Alert_InterruptionSystem
  AGOS – Water Monitoring and Interruption Alert System is a solution to this by giving alerts about water interruptions, monitoring water reserves, and better allocation of water to different sectors. It also includes practical advice on how to get people to use water more wisely. Water is critical to everyday life, and its management is key to satisfying community demands.
# 1.1 Purpose
    AGOS helps communities plan for water-related events better or manage their resources and provides a platform to save water. 
    This project describes what is necessary to set up and operate the Agos system.
# 1.2 Scope
Agos is a water monitoring and alert system designed to:
Notify communities of water interruptions through an application.
Monitor and track the quantity of water reserves.
Optimize water distribution to avoid shortages.
Promote efficient water consumption through educational tips and updates.
  The system targets local communities, government units, water service providers, environmental groups, educational institutions, and emergency response teams. It seeks to improve water resource management and reduce the impact of interruptions.
